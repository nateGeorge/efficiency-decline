# efficiency-decline

This code parses through some efficiency data from many manufacturing runs, and fits a line to different parts of the data 
for each run. It then saves plots of the fits to the data, and saves a compilation of the fit values for each run. A demo 
image of the fit to the normalized efficiency data for one run is included, as is the normalized efficiency slope from 
all of the runs in the dataset.
